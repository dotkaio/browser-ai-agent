- **Interactive Side Panel**: Intuitive chat interface with real-time status updates
- **Task Automation**: Seamlessly automate repetitive web tasks across websites
- **Follow-up Questions**: Ask contextual follow-up questions about completed tasks
- **Conversation History**: Easily access and manage your AI agent interaction history
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Connect your preferred LLM providers and assign different models to different agents

## Browser Support

   - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (v9.15.1 or higher)

2. **Clone and Build**:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd Browserbrowser
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Build the Extension**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **Load the Extension**:
   * The built extension will be in the `dist` directory
   * Follow the installation steps from the Manually Install section to load the extension into your browser

6. **Development Mode** (optional):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Choosing Your Models

Browser allows you to configure different LLM models for each agent to balance performance and cost. Here are recommended configurations:

### Better Performance
- **Planner**: Claude Sonnet 4
  - Better reasoning and planning capabilities
- **Navigator**: Claude Haiku 3.5
  - Efficient for web navigation tasks
  - Good balance of performance and cost

### Cost-Effective Configuration
- **Planner**: Claude Haiku or GPT-4o
  - Reasonable performance at lower cost
  - May require more iterations for complex tasks
- **Navigator**: Gemini 2.5 Flash or GPT-4o-mini
  - Lightweight and cost-efficient
  - Suitable for basic navigation tasks

### Local Models
- **Setup Options**:
  - Use Ollama or other custom OpenAI-compatible providers to run models locally
  - Zero API costs and complete privacy with no data leaving your machine

- **Recommended Models**:
  - **Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507**
  - **Falcon3 10B**
  - **Qwen 2.5 Coder 14B**
  - **Mistral Small 24B**

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Local models require more specific and cleaner prompts
  - Avoid high-level, ambiguous commands
  - Break complex tasks into clear, detailed steps
  - Provide explicit context and constraints

> **Note**: The cost-effective configuration may produce less stable outputs and require more iterations for complex tasks.

> **Tip**: Feel free to experiment with your own model configurations!

## Example Tasks

Here are some powerful tasks you can accomplish with just a sentence:

1. **News Summary**:
   > "Go to TechCrunch and extract top 10 headlines from the last 24 hours"

2. **GitHub Research**:
   > "Look for the trending Python repositories on GitHub with most stars"

3. **Shopping Research**:
   > "Find a portable Bluetooth speaker on Amazon with a water-resistant design, under $50. It should have a minimum battery life of 10 hours"
